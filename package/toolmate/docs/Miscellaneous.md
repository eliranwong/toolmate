# Run Python Code Directly

There are 3 different ways to run python code with ToolMate AI (The first two methods above requires `developer mode` to be enabled.):

1. Enter python code directly into ToolMate AI prompt, e.g.

> print("Hello World!")

2. Enclose your python code with ``` and enter directly into ToolMate AI prompt, e.g.

> ```print("Hello World!")```

The second method supports auto-correction feature whereas the first method does not.

3. Use tool `@extract_python_code` or `@execute_python_code`. For example, to extract and run the python code in assistant previous response, simply run:

> @execute_python_code
