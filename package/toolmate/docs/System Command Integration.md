## System Command Integration

Two new tools were added from Version: 0.2.90+

`@command` Execute the given command

`@append_command` Append assistant previous response to the given command and execute.

```
@command echo "Hello World!"
@append_command echo
```

These new tools work with multiple tools in a single prompt.

For an example, to integrate `fabric` with other ToolMate AI tools, you may do something like this:

```
@command /home/ubuntu/go/bin/fabric -m gemini-1.5-pro -p write_essay "What is machine learning?"
@append_command /home/ubuntu/go/bin/fabric -m llama3.1:latest -p extract_wisdom
@append_command /home/ubuntu/go/bin/fabric -m mistral-large:123b -p summarize
gemini Explain it to a five-year kid
chatgpt Translate it into Chinese
```

# Difference from running system command on their own?

System Command integration in ToolMate AI allows interaction of any system commands with other AI tools, supported by ToolMate AI. System command output is directly integrated into the main ToolMate AI message chain.
