# Reflection Agents

Two reflection agents are developed to mimic the reflection feature performed by the LLM [Reflection Llama 3.1 70b](https://huggingface.co/mattshumer/Reflection-Llama-3.1-70B).  Both are created to work with any LLMs, without the need of running Reflection Llama 3.1 70b.

`@reflection` - to reflect on a given query

`@deep_reflection` - to reflect deeply and in detail on a given query

To compare these two tools, both follow a `Think -> Review -> Refine` pattern, but `@deep_reflection` provides a more detailed analysis and response than `@reflection`.

# How to Use

First, make sure plugin `reflection` is enabled.

Enter either `@reflection ` or `@deep_reflection ` followed by your query

For examples:

```
@reflection Is it better to drink wine in the morning, afternoon, or evening?     
```

```
@deep_reflection Is it better to drink wine in the morning, afternoon, or evening?     
```

# An Example 

In this example, we ask the same model, "mixtral-8x7b-32768," the same query, "Is it better to drink wine in the morning, afternoon, or evening?", comparing tools "@reflection" and "@deep_reflection."

## Reflection

Input:

```
@reflection Is it better to drink wine in the morning, afternoon, or evening?     
```

Output:

```  
@chat: `Reflection` Is it better to drink wine in the morning, afternoon, or evening? 

<thinking>
I will approach this query by considering the potential effects of drinking wine at different times of the day. This 
will involve examining factors such as the body's internal clock, or circadian rhythm, and how alcohol metabolism varies
throughout the day. 

1. Investigate the body's circadian rhythm and its potential impact on alcohol metabolism.
2. Examine how alcohol metabolism varies at different times of the day.
3. Analyze the social implications of drinking wine in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

<reflection>
In my initial thinking, I've outlined a plan to investigate the body's internal clock and alcohol metabolism, as well as
social implications. This approach should provide a comprehensive answer, considering both physiological and societal 
factors. 

1. The body's circadian rhythm and alcohol metabolism are well-researched topics, so I am confident in my ability to 
find relevant information.
2. Social implications may vary depending on cultural norms, so I should ensure to consider a variety of perspectives.
</reflection>

</thinking>

<output>
After considering the body's circadian rhythm and alcohol metabolism, as well as social implications, I can conclude 
that it is generally better to drink wine in the evening. 

1. The body's circadian rhythm: The body's internal clock regulates various physiological processes, including metabol
ism. A study published in the journal "Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research" found that alcohol is metabolized
more slowly in the morning, which could lead to higher blood alcohol concentrations and potentially more severe hango
vers.

2. Alcohol metabolism: Alcohol is metabolized by the liver, which has a limited capacity to process alcohol. Drinking 
wine in the evening allows the liver more time to metabolize the alcohol before the next day's activities.

3. Social implications: Drinking wine in the morning or afternoon may be seen as inappropriate or indicative of a 
problem in many cultures. Drinking in the evening, particularly with meals, is a more socially accepted time for alcohol
consumption.

In conclusion, drinking wine in the evening is the most appropriate time, considering both the body's circadian rhythm 
and alcohol metabolism, as well as social norms and expectations.

## Deep Reflection

Input:

```
@deep_reflection Is it better to drink wine in the morning, afternoon, or evening?     
```

Output:

@chat: `Think` Is it better to drink wine in the morning, afternoon, or evening? 

<thinking>

1. Understand the Query:
   a. The main question is about the best time of the day to drink wine.
   b. There are no explicit constraints or limitations mentioned.
   c. The expected output format is a well-reasoned answer.

2. Outline the Approach:
   a. This query requires factual recall and logical reasoning.
   b. I will first recall general knowledge about wine and its effects on the body.
   c. Then, I will consider the typical daily routines and activities to determine the most suitable time.

3. Present a Plan:
   a. Recall general knowledge about wine and its effects on the body.
   b. Identify typical daily routines and activities.
   c. Consider the effects of wine consumption during different times of the day.
   d. Provide a well-reasoned answer.

</thinking>

While it's a matter of personal preference, there are some factors to consider when determining the best time of the day
to drink wine. Wine, especially red wine, contains alcohol and antioxidants, which can have various effects on the body.

Typical daily routines and activities can also influence the best time for wine consumption. Here's a breakdown of the 
day with these factors in mind:

Morning:
- Alcohol can cause dehydration, which might lead to headaches or fatigue, affecting productivity.
- Drinking wine in the morning is generally not recommended due to its potential impact on focus and daily activities.

Afternoon:
- After a meal, wine can aid digestion and help you relax.
- However, consuming alcohol in the afternoon might interfere with work or other responsibilities, depending on 
individual tolerance and the amount consumed.

Evening:
- Wine can be a great way to unwind after a long day.
- Consuming wine in moderation during the evening is generally more socially acceptable and less likely to interfere 
with daily activities.

In conclusion, drinking wine in the evening is often the most suitable time, considering its effects on the body and 
typical daily routines. However, personal preferences and individual tolerance to alcohol should always be taken into 
account. Remember, moderation is key.

<content>Is it better to drink wine in the morning, afternoon, or evening?</content>

<thinking>

To provide an improved response, let's consider the following factors:

1. General knowledge about wine and its effects on the body.
2. The typical daily routines and activities.
3. Specific effects of wine consumption during different times of the day.

</thinking>

Wine, particularly red wine, contains alcohol and antioxidants, which can have various effects on the body. Drinking 
wine in moderation can have health benefits, but excessive consumption may lead to negative consequences.

Typical daily routines and activities can influence the best time for wine consumption. Here's a breakdown of the day 
with these factors in mind:

Morning:
- Alcohol can cause dehydration, which might lead to headaches or fatigue, affecting productivity.
- Drinking wine in the morning is generally not recommended due to its potential impact on focus and daily activities.

Afternoon:
- After a meal, wine can aid digestion and help you relax.
- Wine contains antioxidants, which may have heart-health benefits when consumed in moderation.
- However, consuming alcohol in the afternoon might interfere with work or other responsibilities, depending on 
individual tolerance and the amount consumed.

Evening:
- Wine can be a great way to unwind after a long day.
- Consuming wine in moderation during the evening is generally more socially acceptable and less likely to interfere 
with daily activities.
- Drinking wine in the evening may also help improve sleep quality for some individuals, as it can promote relaxation.

In conclusion, drinking wine in the evening is often the most suitable time, considering its effects on the body and 
typical daily routines. However, personal preferences and individual tolerance to alcohol should always be taken into 
account. Remember, moderation is key.

For additional context, it's worth noting that some studies suggest that the best time to drink wine may be during meals
, as it can aid digestion and help absorb nutrients. Additionally, consuming wine during meals may reduce the risk of 
negative effects associated with excessive alcohol consumption.
